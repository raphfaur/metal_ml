# metal-ml
metal-ml is an Apple Silicon GPU accelerated library offering various data structures and algorithms.  
It is built on the Metal shading language as well as the metal-cpp bindings.

## Python
The library is also intended to be ported to python, through a standard C python extension.

## Data structures
- (WIP) `mtl_map` a parallelized hashmap supporting integer keys and values up to 32 bits each.

## Algorithms
- (TBD) `mtl_kmean` a kmean algorithm for arbitrary dimension spaces.s
